                🌱 Why AfyaMkononi Was Born
    1️⃣ Healthcare Accessibility Challenges in Kenya
        > Many rural and peri-urban communities lack access to quality healthcare.
        > Expectant mothers and caregivers often travel long distances for checkups, leading to delays or skipped visits.
        > Limited availability of specialized maternal and child healthcare professionals in many counties.
    2️⃣ Digital Health as a Bridge
        > Increasing mobile and internet penetration in Kenya (~46 million internet users as of 2024).
        > Opportunity to leverage mobile/web technology to bring healthcare services closer to families’ hands.
        > Use of teleconsultations to reduce travel costs and barriers for mothers, caregivers, and children needing care.
    3️⃣ Preventive Care and Early Intervention
        > Many maternal and child health issues escalate due to lack of early medical advice.
        > A telecare platform allows timely consultations and monitoring, improving outcomes for mothers and children.
    4️⃣ Addressing Overburdened Facilities
        > Kenyan healthcare facilities often face high patient-to-provider ratios.
        > A telemedicine solution can triage non-critical cases, enabling hospitals to prioritize emergencies.
    5️⃣ Empowerment Through Knowledge
        > Mothers and caregivers often lack clear, locally relevant, and reliable health information.
        > AfyaMkononi’s envisioned resource library empowers users with:
            Nutritional guides.
            Vaccination schedules.
            Developmental milestone information.
            Maternal mental health support.
    6️⃣ Leveraging AI and Digital Tools
        > AI symptom checkers can help preliminary assessments before seeing a doctor.
        > Scheduling and digital record-keeping reduce paperwork and manual errors.

In summary:
AfyaMkononi was born to:
✅ Bring maternal and child healthcare within reach for every mother and child in Kenya.
✅ Reduce barriers to healthcare (distance, cost, wait times).

This mission aligns with SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) while leveraging local digital adoption trends.




1. Implementing the Learning Hub:

This feature requires content creation, storage, and a user interface to display it.

Step 1: Content Strategy & Creation:

Define the specific topics for each module (Sex education, Pregnancy stages, Nutrition, etc.).
Determine the format for each piece of content (text, short videos, infographics).
Create the content in both English and Kiswahili.
Consider the tone and language to be culturally sensitive and easy to understand for young women.
Organize the content into a logical structure (modules, lessons, topics).
Step 2: Data Model Design:

Design a database schema to store your educational content. This might include tables for:
modules: Module title, description.
lessons: Lesson title, module ID, order within module.
content_items: Content type (text, video, image), lesson ID, text content, video URL, image URL, language (English/Kiswahili).
Step 3: Backend API Development:

Create API endpoints to:
Fetch a list of all modules.
Fetch all lessons within a specific module.
Fetch content items for a specific lesson, filtered by language.
Step 4: Frontend UI Development:

Design and build the user interface for the Learning Hub. This will involve:
A landing page displaying the available modules.
Module pages listing the lessons within each module.
Lesson pages displaying the content items (text, videos, images).
Implement a language switcher for users to select English or Kiswahili.
Ensure the UI is responsive and works well on mobile devices.
Step 5: Content Management (Optional but Recommended):

Consider building a simple admin interface or using a headless CMS to easily manage and update the educational content without requiring code changes.
Step 6: Testing:

Thoroughly test the content display, language switching, and navigation within the Learning Hub.
2. Implementing Health Tracking (Simple Pregnancy Tracker & Reminders):

This feature involves capturing user data, calculating milestones, and displaying relevant information and reminders.

Step 1: Data Model Design:

Modify your user profile schema (or create a new table) to store the user's last menstrual period (LMP) or estimated due date (EDD).
Consider adding a table for reminders, including reminder type (nutrition, checkup), date/time, and associated user ID.
Step 2: Backend Logic for Tracking:

Develop backend functions to:
Calculate the current pregnancy week based on the LMP or EDD.
Retrieve "what to expect" content for the current week. This content could be stored in a database or a static file.
(For manual reminders) Allow users or admins to set reminders with specific dates and times.
Step 3: Frontend UI Development:

Create a section in the user's dashboard or a dedicated "Health Tracker" page to display:
The current pregnancy week.
"What to expect" information for that week.
A list of upcoming manual reminders.
Provide an interface for users to input their LMP or EDD.
(For manual reminders) Provide an interface for users (or admins) to set and manage reminders.
Step 4: Reminder System (Manual for MVP):

For the MVP, the reminder system can be simple. You could display the reminders on the user's dashboard or send basic in-app notifications. Full push notifications or SMS might be a post-MVP feature.
Step 5: Content for Tracking:

Prepare the "what to expect each week" content. This could be stored in your database or a static file.
Step 6: Testing:

Test the pregnancy week calculation, content display, and reminder functionality.
3. Implementing the Safe Q&A Section:

This feature requires a way for users to ask questions, for professionals to answer, and a mechanism for verifying professionals.

Step 1: Data Model Design:

Create tables for:
questions: User ID (optional for anonymous), question text, timestamp, status (e.g., "pending," "answered").
answers: Question ID, healthcare professional User ID, answer text, timestamp.
Step 2: Backend API Development:

Create API endpoints to:
Allow authenticated users to submit questions (with an option for anonymity).
Fetch a list of questions (perhaps filtered by status or category).
Allow authenticated healthcare professionals to submit answers to pending questions.
Fetch answers for a specific question.
Step 3: Frontend UI Development:

Design and build the UI for the Q&A section:
A page where users can view existing questions and answers.
A form for users to submit new questions (with an option to be anonymous).
A separate interface for healthcare professionals to view pending questions and submit answers.
Clearly display the healthcare professional's name or identifier with their answer.
Step 4: Healthcare Professional Verification:

Implement a process for verifying that a user is a genuine healthcare professional before allowing them to answer questions. This could involve:
Manual verification by an admin.
Collecting and reviewing professional credentials.
Assigning a specific "healthcare_professional" role to verified users in your database.
Step 5: Moderation (Optional but Recommended):

Consider a simple moderation process for questions and answers to ensure the content remains safe and appropriate.
Step 6: Testing:

Test the question submission, answering process, and display of questions and answers. Ensure the anonymity option works correctly.





MVP Core Feature 1: User Onboarding & Profile Creation

🎯 Goal: Enable simple registration and basic user profiles for patients and healthcare professionals with minimal barriers.

✅ Key MVP Requirements:

Simple registration (email/phone).
User profiles with:
Name
Age
Pregnancy stage (if applicable for patients)
Preferences for content and notifications
Minimal complex forms.
Step-by-Step Implementation:

Refine Data Model for User Profiles:

Ensure your database schema (likely in Supabase, as per workflow.md) has the necessary fields for both patient and healthcare professional profiles.
For patients, include fields for name, age, pregnancy_stage (can be an optional field or an integer representing weeks), and preferences (perhaps a JSON field or separate boolean flags for notifications/content types).
For healthcare professionals, you'll need fields like name, specialization, and potentially a field to store their verification status (e.g., is_verified boolean).
Implement Registration Forms (Frontend):

Create separate registration forms for patients and healthcare professionals.
Patient Registration Form:
Include fields for email or phone number (depending on your primary registration method), password, name, age, and optionally pregnancy stage.
Keep the form concise and easy to fill out.
Healthcare Professional Registration Form:
Include fields for email or phone number, password, name, and specialization.
MVP Note: For the MVP, the verification process for healthcare professionals can be manual initially (e.g., an admin reviews their submission). You don't need a complex automated verification system yet.
Utilize reusable UI components like your src/components/ui/button.tsx for form submission buttons.
Implement Backend Registration Logic:

Create API endpoints on your backend (Supabase Functions or your chosen backend) to handle user registration.
When a patient registers:
Validate the input data.
Create a new user in your authentication system (Supabase Auth).
Create a corresponding entry in your patient profile table with the provided details.
When a healthcare professional registers:
Validate the input data.
Create a new user in your authentication system.
Create a corresponding entry in your healthcare professional profile table. Initially set their is_verified status to false or pending.
Implement Login Forms (Frontend):

Create a login form with fields for email/phone number and password.
Use your src/components/ui/button.tsx for the login button.
Implement Backend Login Logic:

Create an API endpoint for user login.
Authenticate the user against your authentication system (Supabase Auth).
Upon successful login, generate and return an authentication token (like a JWT) to the frontend.
Implement User Dashboards and Redirects (Frontend):

Create separate dashboard pages for logged-in patients and healthcare professionals.
After successful login, redirect patients to the patient dashboard and healthcare professionals to the healthcare professional dashboard, as outlined in your workflow.md.
Use the authentication token received from the backend to maintain the user's session.
Implement Basic Profile Viewing/Editing (Frontend):

On the respective dashboards, allow users to view their basic profile information (name, age, pregnancy stage for patients; name, specialization for professionals).
For the MVP, a simple "Edit Profile" button that allows users to update these basic fields would be sufficient.
Implement Backend Profile Management Logic:

Create API endpoints to fetch and update user profile data.
Ensure that users can only access and modify their own profile information (implement proper authorization checks).
Integrate Preferences (MVP Basic):

On the patient profile editing page, include a simple way for users to indicate preferences (e.g., checkboxes for notification types, or a dropdown for preferred content topics).
Store these preferences in the patient profile table.
MVP Note: The implementation of using these preferences (e.g., filtering content based on preferences) can come later. For the MVP, just having the ability to store them is sufficient.
Add Error Handling and Validation:

Implement frontend and backend validation for all forms to ensure data integrity.
Display clear error messages to users in case of invalid input or registration/login failures.
Testing:

Thoroughly test the entire onboarding and profile creation flow for both patient and healthcare professional users.
Test registration, login, profile viewing, and profile editing.
Test edge cases (e.g., invalid input, existing email addresses).
