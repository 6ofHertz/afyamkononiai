# Project Guide

## Project Overview

AfyaMkononi is a tele-healthcare application specifically designed to support maternal and child health. Recognizing the importance of accessible and timely healthcare for mothers and children, this project provides a platform that connects patients with healthcare providers and offers AI-powered tools for health information and initial symptom assessment. The goal is to empower individuals with knowledge and facilitate convenient access to medical guidance.

## How the Project Was Built

This project was built using a modern web development stack, leveraging the speed and efficiency of Vite, the robustness of TypeScript and React for the frontend, and the comprehensive backend-as-a-service capabilities of Supabase. The user interface was crafted using shadcn-ui and Tailwind CSS for a consistent and responsive design. The integration of the Gemini API enabled the development of the AI-powered features that are central to the application's functionality.

## Project Contents

The project is organized into several key areas:

*   **User Interface:** Built with React components, styled with Tailwind CSS, and utilizing shadcn-ui for pre-built UI elements.
*   **Pages:** Different sections of the application, such as the landing page, login/register pages, dashboards for doctors and patients, and dedicated pages for the AI Health Assistant and Symptom Checker.
*   **Components:** Reusable building blocks for the UI, ranging from basic buttons and forms to more complex elements like resource cards and navigation bars.
*   **Hooks:** Custom React hooks to encapsulate and share logic across components.
*   **Libraries:** External libraries for various functionalities, including routing (React Router) and potentially state management or data fetching.
*   **Integrations:** Code responsible for interacting with external services, primarily Supabase for backend operations and the Gemini API for AI features.
*   **Supabase Backend:** Provides the database, authentication, and other backend services.

## What the Project Contains

*   **User Authentication:** Secure registration and login for patients and doctors.
*   **Doctor Dashboard:** A dedicated interface for doctors to manage appointments, view patient information, and potentially communicate with patients.
*   **Patient Dashboard:** An interface for patients to access their health information, book appointments, and use the AI tools.
*   **AI Health Assistant:** An interactive chat interface where users can ask health-related questions and receive information generated by the Gemini API.
*   **Symptom Checker:** A tool that takes user-provided symptoms as input and provides potential insights or suggestions, powered by the Gemini API.
*   **Resource Display:** Functionality to display health resources, possibly articles, videos, or other relevant information.
*   **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be accessible and usable across different devices.

## What the Project Does NOT Contain

*   **Emergency Medical Advice:** The AI Health Assistant and Symptom Checker are not substitutes for professional medical advice. They are intended for informational purposes only.
*   **Direct Medical Treatment:** The platform facilitates connections and provides information but does not offer direct medical treatment or diagnosis.
*   **Integration with Electronic Health Records (EHR) Systems:** As of now, there is no integration with external EHR systems for comprehensive patient record management beyond what is stored in the application's database.
*   **Pharmacy Integration:** The project does not include features for ordering medications or integrating with pharmacies.
*   **Payment Gateway Integration:** There is no built-in functionality for processing payments for consultations or services.
